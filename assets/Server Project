# Server Project

I'm current working on my [Minecraft Bedrock Server SMP](https://github.com/PinozenTH/SMP-Server)

You can join my Server on [Omlet Arcade](https://omlet.gg/profile/pinozen.thailand)

My Server is still in ***Beta Testing*** so there are many __**bugs**__ have to fixed and get discover I hope you guys will understand it

My SMP have a __*Custom biome*__ from [Expansive Biomes](https://mcpedl.com/plenty-o-biomes-addon/)

I hosted server on my Own PC so sometimes I have to __**Shutdown**__ my server if my PC is overheat or You will get Disconnect If my internet is down

I also have **domain** that from [playit.gg](https://playit.gg) I paid it 6$/years and it think that is enough for me to get start!

I hosted My Server From **9:00** to **21:00** so if you wanna join Just Come on time!

If Server didn't get host on that time that mean I'm Busy or my PC Crashed or My Internet down
